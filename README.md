flappy bird

# My first attempt  to create generational neural network

# List of my questions to AI gods

1. Can this game be beaten?
    1. If yes than is it to hard?
    2. If not, why?
    3. Are the spacings of obstacles wrong?
    4. Gravity ? Player size?
    5. What is the difference between original flappy bird and this version?
2. How to test it? It must be done algorithmically coz human error.
3. Easier version should be easier to learn wright?
4. Is it a problem with NN?
5. The layer sizes? The leaning algorithm?
6. Should the learning rate change? - YES
7. OK how?
    1. With parameters to look at, when changing the learning rate?
    2. By how much should be leaning rate adjusted?
8. If we divide learning rate than players will be better suited to play the game in specific way, but will not learn
   any new ways.
9. Ts it the problem with leaning algorithm?
    1. It randomly generates players, maybe the generated values are generated in incorrect range.
    2. Should It be done in this way?
10. Should learning be so slow, or is it normal?
